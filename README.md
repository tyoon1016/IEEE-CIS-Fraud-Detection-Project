# Mod5 Project - IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection
## Introduction

In this project, I am utilizing machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset to distinguish fraudulent card transaction from dataset from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions. The goal is to predict the probability of online transaction is fraudulent, as marked by binary target isFraud.

## Dataset

Dataset was provided from IEEE-CIS. Files are 
- test_identity
- test_transaction
- train_identity
- tran_transaction

Files were too big to upload straight to my github.

## PRoblem Statement

- Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of a credit/debit card, fraudulently obtaining money or property. 
- Cases of Credit Card Fraud have increased every year in US.
- Credit Card fraud costs consumers and financial companies billions of dollars every year.
- Developing a fraud detection system is important to prevent losses across the various parties. 

## Methodology

By below gradient goosting method, I will predict fradulent customers/cards.
